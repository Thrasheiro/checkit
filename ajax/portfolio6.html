    <p>I sketched out tons of possible UI's for the fuctionality of our Roommates app. First, I used an iPhone app called <a href="https://popapp.in/">Prototype on Paper</a> to make a functional prototype right on my phone. As a group, we used the sketches to build out the app on Adobe Illustrator with the same functionality. After doing some user testing on our app in <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, I took the findings and reiterated in <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch App</a>, which I quickly realized works much better with InVision than Illustrator.</p>
